# Layer discipline, because it is where the build time goes.
#
# Every instruction below commits a layer, and committing a layer means walking
# the whole root filesystem to produce the diff. On the hosted runner that is
# about ten seconds per layer before the package transaction and forty seconds
# per layer after it, when /usr is several gigabytes. The eighteen one-file
# COPYs this used to open with cost three minutes on their own, for a few
# kilobytes of scripts. So sources are copied in as few instructions as the
# distinct origins allow, and small RUN steps are folded into their neighbours.
#
# The per-image build arguments (name, flavor, version, commit) are declared
# late, immediately before the first step that reads them, and the labels
# that quote them come last. A build argument is part of the cache key of
# every RUN declared after it, whether that RUN uses it or not -- so with
# VERSION declared at the top, the package transaction missed the registry
# layer cache on every commit, since VERSION carries the date and the commit.
# Declared here, nothing above the branding step ever sees them.

# Manifests, the desktop contract, and the repository definitions the package
# transaction reads. These, the pinned package image and the install script
# are the whole input to the expensive layer, so everything else waits its
# turn below them.

# /etc/utah-packages, nothing ever removed it, and it was two thirds of every
# published image and of every live ISO, whose squashfs holds the image (#128).
# Reproducibility still comes from the digest-pinned `packages` stage, which is
# the only source the package transaction can see -- that is what the old
# comment meant by "does not depend on a mutable Pages mirror." The mount is a
# BuildKit RUN --mount, so it costs no layer and leaves nothing on disk.

# GNOME 51 removed, so it errored at load and failed the ISO end-to-end test.
# Settings for an extension the image does not carry are noise in dconf.

# This first check covers the flavor-independent contract only, which is why it
# pins IMAGE_FLAVOR=main. verify-rpm-contract.py reads IMAGE_FLAVOR from the
# environment, and the build sets it, so without this the nvidia flavors
# asserted here that nvidia-driver, nvidia-driver-cuda and
# nvidia-container-toolkit were installed -- several steps before

# after the NVIDIA and OGC step.
#
# Utah keeps Bluefin's user-facing package contract.  Hummingbird supplies the
# bootable base; the pinned Utah package repository and Hummingbird's own
# repository supply the desktop and the rest.  Fedora repositories are never
# enabled at runtime -- they are bootstrap material for the package factory's
# buildroot, not a source of installed packages.
# A missing package is a build failure: silently skipping one would make parity
# claims meaningless.  The only exceptions are the packages listed under
# [unavailable] in packages/utah.toml, each of which carries a tracking issue.
#
# The package lists live in the manifests, not here.  When they were spelled
# out in this RUN as well, the two copies drifted and the contract check was
# asserting a different set than the install had asked for.
