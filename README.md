†Utahraptor ostrommaysi

Bluefin built on Fedora Hummingbird. The more ... civilized murder machine.

> Your day keeps getting worse. Why are there more.

**Experimental pre-alpha** — the image builds, boots, and reaches GDM in local
QEMU validation. No image has been published to a registry, there is no
installer payload, and no ISO has been released. Nothing here is ready to run on
a machine you care about. [Filing
issues](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah/issues) is the whole point.

## What it is

[Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io) built on [Fedora
Hummingbird](https://packages.redhat.com), which supplies a hardened, fast-moving
bootable base and no desktop at all. Utah adds the desktop: Bluefin's package
contract on top, and the GNOME 51 stack built from source because neither
Hummingbird nor a Fedora release ships it.

Two repositories, the way `common` and `brew` already work:

| Repository | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`projectbluefin/utah`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah) | This one. Composes the image. |
| [`projectbluefin/utah-packages`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/utah-packages) | Builds GNOME 51 and the rest of the desktop stack from verified upstream sources, and publishes them as an OCI image. |

## Image streams

| Tag | Stream | What it is |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `:testing` | Dev | Built from `testing`, advanced only after end-to-end validation. |
| `:stable` | Stable | Promoted from `:testing`. |

Four flavors per stream — `utah`, `utah-nvidia`, `utah-gaming`,
`utah-nvidia-gaming` — matching Bluefin's. `config/flavors.json` is the single
source for that set, for the promote and release matrices, and for whether the
kernel cache image gets built at all.

**None of these are published yet.** The tags above describe what the pipeline
is built to produce, not something you can pull today.

## Package parity with Bluefin

`packages/bluefin.toml` is a byte-for-byte copy of Bluefin's `base.toml`, and CI
diffs it against upstream on every run, so drift fails the build rather than
being noticed later.

| | count |
| --- | --- |
| Bluefin contract installed | **61** |
| Utah additions (GNOME 51, desktop services) | 12 |
| Genuinely unavailable | **4** |

The install writes its resolved list to `/usr/share/utah/contract.txt` and the
verify step asserts *that file*, so the two cannot disagree.



## Known gaps

This is the honest list, and it is why the label above says pre-alpha.

- **Nothing is published.** No image, no ISO artifact, no installer. A live
  ISO builds locally (`just iso`); installer payload integration is the next
  ISO milestone.
- **Live media boot paths and Secure Boot.** Live media requires UEFI boot;
  legacy BIOS and file-backed/Ventoy booting are explicitly unsupported (flash
  directly using Fedora Media Writer or `dd`). As a documented exception
  (Issue #22), live media runs SELinux in Permissive mode (`enforcing=0`)
  because rootless container squashfs generation cannot preserve SELinux xattrs;
  installed target systems boot Enforcing normally. The live ESP boots
  Fedora-signed shim + GRUB, so live media boots with Secure Boot enabled. The
  stock kernel is Fedora-signed; the source-built OGC kernel and NVIDIA modules
  are signed with the Utah MOK and need one `utah-enroll-secure-boot-key` run
  (password `utahraptor`) plus the MokManager confirmation on those flavors.
- **Cross-vendor switch and update timers (`bootc-fetch-apply-updates`).**
  Switching to Utah from Bluefin or other bootc images carries Bluefin's
  `/etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer`
  symlink across ostree's 3-way `/etc` merge. Utah masks
  `bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer` and `bootc-fetch-apply-updates.service` in
  both `/etc` and `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` (and presets them to disabled) so
  background auto-updates do not bypass `uupd` policy or silently undo a
  rollback (`bootc rollback`). Switchers should verify with
  `systemctl is-enabled bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer` and can re-assert the
  mask (`systemctl mask --now bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer bootc-fetch-apply-updates.service`)
  if a merged `/etc` wants symlink remains on disk (links #17, #101).
- **The NVIDIA and gaming flavors are unproven.** The OGC kernel compiles with
  `sched_ext` and `binderfs` genuinely enabled, and the NVIDIA open module
  compiles for the base kernel. The module against the OGC kernel, the driver
  installer flags, and the flavored builds pulling the kernel cache image have
  not yet all passed in one run.
- **`pipewire-libs-extra` is missing.** It was never a Fedora package; it exists
  only in negativo17's `fedora-multimedia`, which Bluefin enables for its whole
  install.
- **Codec support differs.** Twelve `[multimedia_overrides]` names are packages
  Fedora already ships and Bluefin *replaces* with negativo17 builds. Utah
  installs Fedora's. Nothing is absent from the image; hardware-accelerated
  codecs are what differ. `utah-packages` already builds several of them, so
  this closes when Utah consumes that overlay.
- **The image is still pre-alpha.** The digest-pinned `utah-packages` OCI
  repository is consumed and the local QEMU image reaches GDM and GNOME Shell.
- **CUDA is deliberately excluded** — 7.68 GB installed. Use the NVIDIA
  container toolkit, which is included, and run CUDA in a container.
