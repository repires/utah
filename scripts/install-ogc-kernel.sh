# Put the OGC kernel used by Dakota's gaming images into this image.  Hummingbird
# publishes no OGC RPM, so this is intentionally a source build rather than a
# silently substituted Fedora kernel.
#
# Compiling it takes about half an hour, and it depends on nothing this image
# does -- only on the base image and the pin below.  Rebuilding it on every push
# was pure waste, so the compile is hoisted into a cache image built from
# Containerfile.kernel and keyed by those two inputs; see `just kernel-cache-tag`.
# When that image is the base, the kernel arrives as a tarball and this script
# unpacks it.  With no cache present -- a local `just build`, or the cache image's
# own build -- it falls through to the source build, so both paths stay exercised
# and neither can rot unnoticed.

# dracut's dmsquash-live requires overlayfs and reads a zstd squashfs through
# a loop device. Installed OSTree roots and the LUKS ISO test need the other
# filesystem/device-mapper features too; x86 defconfig is not a live-OS config.
#
# A display, too. x86_64 defconfig turns on DRM and i915 and nothing else, so
# on any machine whose GPU is not an Intel iGPU -- every QEMU guest included --
# the kernel registered no DRM device at all. GDM started, mutter found no KMS
# device to open, and the gaming flavors failed the ISO end-to-end test on a
# black screen with "no gnome-shell running for liveuser", while main, on the
# distribution kernel, came up through simpledrm on the firmware framebuffer.
# SYSFB_SIMPLEFB makes sysfb hand the EFI/VESA framebuffer to a
# simple-framebuffer device, and DRM_SIMPLEDRM drives it: an unaccelerated but
# real KMS device on any hardware, until a native driver takes over.
#
# The root filesystem, too. Utah installs to btrfs on LUKS, and x86_64
# defconfig has no BTRFS_FS, so the gaming flavors could format a root
# volume and then not mount it. The installer got all the way to
#
#     mkfs.btrfs -f -L root /dev/mapper/fisherman-root     (ok)
#     mount -t btrfs /dev/mapper/fisherman-root /mnt/fisherman-target
#     mount: unknown filesystem type 'btrfs'
#     fisherman: fatal: mounting root: ... exit status 32
#
# and the ISO test failed at phase 3 on both gaming flavors. It had never
# reached that phase before: the missing KMS device below stopped it at
# phase 2, so this list was written for the live-boot and LUKS paths and
# nobody had yet needed the filesystem the disk is actually made of.
# BTRFS_FS selects its own crc, zlib, lzo, zstd, raid6 and xor helpers, so
# naming it is enough for olddefconfig to pull the rest in.
