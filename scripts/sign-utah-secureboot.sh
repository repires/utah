# Sign Utah's custom kernels and out-of-tree modules for Secure Boot.
#
# This mirrors ublue-os/akmods' MOK model: one long-lived Utah Machine Owner
# Key signs everything Fedora's own key does not (the source-built OGC kernel
# and the NVIDIA open modules). The public certificate ships in the image and
# the user enrolls it once with utah-enroll-secure-boot-key; the private key
# lives only in the kernel-cache builder and never in a shipped layer.
#
# Usage:
#   sign-utah-secureboot.sh kernel <release>
#     sbsign the OGC vmlinuz for <release> and verify it with sbverify.
#   sign-utah-secureboot.sh modules <release> <moduledir>
#     sign every .ko under <moduledir> with the kernel's sign-file and the
#     Utah MOK, so lockdown accepts them once the MOK is enrolled.
#
# Key material comes from ${UTAH_SECUREBOOT_KEYDIR:-packages/secureboot}:
# utah-mok.priv (private) and utah-mok.der (public). When the private key is
# absent -- a plain local build outside the kernel-cache image -- signing is
# skipped with a warning and the kernel stays unsigned, exactly like akmods'
# test-key fallback. An unsigned custom kernel cannot boot under Secure Boot.
