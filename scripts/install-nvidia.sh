# Build NVIDIA's open kernel module from source against the kernel this image
# actually runs.
#
# This used to pull UBlue's akmods bundle, which cannot work on a Hummingbird
# base. UBlue publishes akmods per exact kernel NEVR, and it builds none for
# Hummingbird's kernel: ghcr.io/ublue-os/akmods-nvidia-open has no tag
# containing 7.1.8 at all -- its newest coreos-stable is
# coreos-stable-44-7.0.9-205.fc44 -- so the derived tag
# coreos-stable-43-7.1.8-100.fc43.x86_64 resolved to nothing and skopeo failed
# with "reading manifest ... unknown". public-hummingbird ships no nvidia
# package either: of its 3,510 packages, zero match nvidia or akmod.
#
# So there is no prebuilt module for this base, and the only remaining source
# is NVIDIA's own.
#
# This used to claim the base image carries the build tree needed for that. It
# does not, and the claim had never been executed: run 33253331819 reached this
# script for the first time and found no /usr/lib/modules/<kernel>/build at all,
# for any kernel. That directory comes from kernel-devel, which a bootc base has
# no reason to ship. It is installed below, and removed again afterwards.
#
# Consequence worth stating plainly: the akmods bundle also supplied the
# userspace RPMs (nvidia-driver, nvidia-driver-cuda, nvidia-container-toolkit).
# A .run install provides the same userspace as files rather than as those RPM
# names, so the contract check asserts the module and driver binaries instead.
#
# nvidia-container-toolkit is the exception, and an earlier version of this
# comment was wrong about it. It said the package had no source here at all,
# reasoning from the akmods bundle being unusable. That does not follow, and
# NVIDIA publishes it directly; it is installed below.
#
# Neither the driver download nor the module compile depends on anything this
# image does, so both are hoisted into the cache image built from
# Containerfile.kernel (see `just kernel-cache-tag`) and reused here.  The
# userspace install is deliberately *not* cached: it runs the vendor installer
# over a populated /usr, and it has to keep happening after the package
# transaction rather than before it.  With no cache present -- a local
# `just build`, or the cache image's own build -- everything below falls through
# to building from source.

# The module build tree comes from kernel-devel, which a bootc base has no

# attempt at a source build. It is needed only to compile against, so it goes in
# here and comes out again below.
#
# It may not be in the repositories this image enables either. Utah enables only
# Hummingbird plus its own package factory, and when the base kernel is not in
# those:
#
#   No match for argument: kernel-devel-<nevr>
#
# Adding the matching Fedora repository would not fix it for long, because a
# repository only carries the current kernel and this image is pinned to a base
# whose kernel will not move. Fedora own build system keeps every build
# indefinitely, so that is where this comes from, addressed by exact NEVR.
#
# Those RPMs are unsigned at that path, so the download is checked against a
# hash recorded here instead. It is a constant because the base image is pinned
# by digest: the kernel cannot change without BASE_IMAGE changing.
#
# Which is exactly why the hash has to move with BASE_IMAGE, and why it is
# recorded here beside the kernel it was taken from rather than on its own. The
# 7.2 base bump left this pinned to 7.1.8-100.fc43 for one revision: the dnf
# path above satisfied 7.2 and the fallback never ran, so nothing failed and
# nothing said the constant had gone stale. It would have failed the first time
# the enabled repositories dropped the kernel -- the precise situation this
# fallback exists for. Pairing the two makes that mismatch loud and immediate
# instead of latent, and costs nothing when they agree.
#
# Both are overridable together, and that pairing is the point. The override on
# the hash exists for exactly one situation -- validating a kernel this file has
# not been re-recorded for -- so a guard that refused to proceed whenever the
# kernel differed from the recorded NEVR would make the override unreachable in
# the only case it is for. Override both, or neither.
